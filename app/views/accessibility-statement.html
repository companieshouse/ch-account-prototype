      <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). If you're not happy with how we

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="technical-information">Technical infomation about this service's accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Companies House is committed to making its services accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        This service is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard. The non-compliances are listed in the next section.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-we-tested">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>
        The following content is non-accessible for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-we-tested">PDFs and other documents</h3>
      <p>
        <p>
      Most PDF documents are not accessible in a number of ways including missing text alternatives and missing document structure (not mentioned by DAC, but still a known issue). This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value). We are investigating a solution to this problem and will update this statement in due course.
