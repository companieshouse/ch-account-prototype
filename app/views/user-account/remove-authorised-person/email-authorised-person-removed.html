    <p class="govuk-body">You are receiving this email to let you know that Hannah Salt's digital authorisation to file online for FLOWERS LIMITED has been removed by Jill Edwards. This means they will no longer be able to file online for this company without a current authentication code. <p>

      {{ govukInsetText({
        text: "Hannah Salt will still be able to file online for this company if they have access to the current authentication code. An authorised person may wish to change it."
      }) }}

    <p class="govuk-body">We've emailed Hannah Salt to let them know they are no longer digitally authorised to file online for this company. We've also emailed anyone else who is authorised to file for this company to let them know that Hannah Salt's digital authorisation has been removed.<p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If Hannah Salt is appointed as an officer of the company, such as a director or secretary, removing their digital authorisation to file online does not remove their appointment.<p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you were not expecting Hannah Saltâ€™s authorisation to file online to be removed, you must resolve this within the company. Companies House cannot give or remove digital authorisation to file online for a company.<p>
