    <p class="govuk-body">You are receiving this email because Jill Edwards has removed your authorisation to file online for FLOWERS LIMITED.<p></p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This means that if you want to file for this company online in the future, you must use a current authentication code.<p></p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you were not expecting your authorisation to file online to be removed, you must resolve this within the company. Companies House cannot give or remove authorisation to file online for a company.<p></p>
